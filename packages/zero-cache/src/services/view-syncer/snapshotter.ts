/**
 * A `Snapshotter` manages the progression of database snapshots for a
 * ViewSyncer.
 *
 * The Replicator and ViewSyncers operate on the same SQLite file, with the
 * Replicator being the sole writer to the database. The IVM logic in
 * ViewSyncers, however, rely on incrementally applying changes to the DB to
 * update the state of its pipelines.
 *
 * To avoid coupling the progress of the Replicator and all IVM pipelines on
 * each other, ViewSyncers operate on ephemeral forks of the database by holding
 * [concurrent](https://sqlite.org/src/doc/begin-concurrent/doc/begin_concurrent.md)
 * snapshots of the database and simulating (but ultimately rolling back)
 * mutations on these snapshots.
 *
 * Example:
 * 1. ViewSyncer takes `snapshot_a` at version `t1` of the database and
 *    hydrates its pipeline(s).
 * 2. Replicator applies a new transaction to the database and notifies
 *    subscribers.
 * 3. ViewSyncer takes `snapshot_b` at `t2`, and queries the `ChangeLog` at
 *    that snapshot for changes since `t1`.
 * 4. ViewSyncer applies those changes to `snapshot_a` for IVM, but does not
 *    commit them. (Recall that the Replicator is the sole writer to the db, so
 *    the ViewSyncer never commits any writes.)
 * 5. Replicator applies the next transaction and advances the database to `t3`.
 * 6. ViewSyncer rolls back `snapshot_a` and opens `snapshot_c` at `t3`, using
 *    `snapshot_b` to simulate changes from `t2` to `t3`.
 *
 * ```
 * Replicator:  t1 --------------> t2 --------------> t3 --------------->
 * ViewSyncer:       [snapshot_a] ----> [snapshot_b] ----> [snapshot_c]
 * ```
 *
 * Note that the Replicator (and ViewSyncers) do not wait on the progress of
 * other ViewSyncers. If a ViewSyncer is busy hydrating at `t1`, the Replicator
 * and other ViewSyncers can progress through `t2`, `t3`, etc. independently,
 * as the busy ViewSyncer simply takes its own snapshot when it is ready.
 *
 * ```
 * Replicator:   t1 --------------> t2 --------------> t3 --------------->
 * ViewSyncer1:       [snapshot_a] ----> [snapshot_b] ----> [snapshot_c]
 * ViewSyncer2:       [.......... snapshot_a ..........] ----> [snapshot_b]
 * ```
 *
 * To minimize Database connections (and statement preparation, etc.), the
 * Snapshotter reuses the connection from the previous (rolled back)
 * snapshot when opening the new one.
 *
 * ```
 * Replicator:  t1 --------------> t2 --------------> t3 --------------->
 * ViewSyncer:       [snapshot_a] ----> [snapshot_b] ----> [snapshot_c]
 *                     (conn_1)           (conn_2)           (conn_1)
 * ```
 *
 * In this manner, each ViewSyncer uses two connections that continually
 * "leapfrog" each other to replay the timeline of changes in isolation from
 * the Replicator and other ViewSyncers.

   * in response to a notification from a Replicator subscription. Subsequent
   * calls to {@link current()} return the new Snapshot. Note that the Snapshotter
   * must be initialized before advancing.
   *
   * The returned {@link SnapshotDiff} contains snapshots at the endpoints
   * of the database timeline. Iterating over the diff generates a sequence
   * of {@link Change}s between the two snapshots.
   *
   * Note that this sequence is not chronological; rather, the sequence is
   * ordered by `<table, row-key>`, such that a row can appear at most once
   * in the common case, or twice if its table is `TRUNCATE`'d and a new value
   * is subsequently `INSERT`'ed. This results in dropping most intermediate
   * changes to a row and bounds the amount of work needed to catch up;
   * however, as a consequence, a consistent database state is only guaranteed
   * when the sequence has been fully consumed.
   *
   * Note that Change generation relies on the state of the underlying
   * database connections, and because the connection for the previous snapshot
   * is reused to produce the next snapshot, the diff object is only valid
   * until the next call to `advance()`.
   *
   * It is okay for the caller to apply `Change`s to the `prev` snapshot
   * during the iteration (e.g. this is necessary for IVM); the remainder
   * of the iteration is not affected because a given row can appear at most
   * once in the sequence (with the exception being TRUNCATE, after which the
   * deleted rows can be re-inserted, but this will also behave correctly if
   * the changes are applied).
   *
   * Once the changes have been applied, however, a _subsequent_ iteration
   * will not produce the correct results. In order to perform multiple
   * change-applying iterations, the caller must (1) create a save point
   * on `prev` before each iteration, and (2) rollback to the save point after
   * the iteration.
